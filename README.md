# PCA-LGBM-BO
This code implements the PCA–LightGBM–GP-based Bayesian Optimization hybrid automatic calibration framework for SWMM proposed in the paper. The framework screens key parameters using LHS–PRCC, compresses multi-site, multi-event water level time series via PCA, and compares three calibration strategies: Inverse LGBM, BO, and Hybrid.
